# Clan Alliances and Rivalries

Any clan leader can send an request to start an alliance with any other clan with `/clan ally add`. If the request is accepted by a leader of the second clan, the alliance is formed. The alliance can be broken by any leader of either clan at any time with `/clan ally remove`, no one needs to accept the removal of an alliance.

Clan rivalries can be started by any clan at any time, no request is needed, rivalries are automatically formed once a clan leader decides he wants one by using `/clan rival add`. If someone has pissed you off and you want them as rivals, their permission is not needed. To break a clan rivalry on the other hand, you need the acceptance of the other clan, you must use `/clan rival remove` to send the other clan a request, once one of their leaders accept the rivalry is broken.

You can view a list of all clans and their allies with the `/clan alliances` command, or their rivals with the `/clan rivalries` command.
